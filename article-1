        <h1>Bitcoin</h1>
        <p>
          Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that was invented in 2008
          by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi
          Nakamoto. It operates on a technology called blockchain, which is a
          distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of
          computers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments, Bitcoin is not
          controlled by any central authority, such as a central bank. Instead,
          it relies on a peer-to-peer network of computers to validate and
          verify transactions. This makes Bitcoin resistant to censorship and
          government interference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bitcoin transactions are secured using cryptographic algorithms. Users
          have a digital wallet that stores their Bitcoin addresses, which are
          used to send and receive funds. Transactions are verified by miners,
          who solve complex mathematical problems to add new blocks to the
          blockchain. Miners are rewarded with newly created Bitcoins for their
          efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bitcoin has gained popularity as a digital currency and a store of
          value. It is used for various purposes, including online purchases,
          remittances, and investment. Its decentralized nature and limited
          supply make it attractive to those seeking an alternative to
          traditional financial systems.
        </p>
        <h2>Example:</h2>
        <p>
          Let's say Alice wants to send 0.05 BTC to Bob. Alice initiates the
          transaction from her Bitcoin wallet by specifying Bob's Bitcoin
          address and the amount to send. The transaction is broadcasted to the
          network, where miners validate and include it in a block. Once
          confirmed, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain, and Bob's
          wallet reflects the new balance of 0.05 BTC.
