        <h1>Understanding Blockchain Technology</h1>
        <p>
          Blockchain technology is a decentralized and distributed ledger system
          that allows multiple parties to maintain a shared record of
          transactions. It has gained popularity due to its transparency,
          security, and immutability.
        </p>
        <h2>How Does Blockchain Work?</h2>
        <p>
          At its core, a blockchain consists of a chain of blocks, where each
          block contains a list of transactions. These blocks are linked
          together using cryptographic hashes, forming an unchangeable record of
          all transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a new transaction occurs, it is added to a block. Miners,
          specialized nodes in the network, compete to solve complex
          mathematical problems to validate and add new blocks to the chain.
          Once a block is added, it is difficult to alter or tamper with the
          data stored within it, ensuring the integrity of the blockchain.
        </p>
        <h2>Key Features of Blockchain</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Decentralization:</strong> Blockchain operates on a
            peer-to-peer network, eliminating the need for a central authority.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Transparency:</strong> All transactions are visible to all
            participants in the network, enhancing trust and accountability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Immutability:</strong> Once a transaction is recorded on the
            blockchain, it is nearly impossible to alter or delete.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Security:</strong> Blockchain uses cryptographic algorithms
            to secure transactions, making it highly resistant to fraud and
            hacking.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Applications of Blockchain</h2>
        <p>
          Blockchain technology has applications beyond cryptocurrencies. It can
          be used for secure and transparent supply chain management, voting
          systems, identity verification, smart contracts, and more.
